"""Organization-admin authority is an explicit grant (OrganizationAdmin),
never inferred from a facility-level StaffMembership role. There is no
"ADMIN" StaffRole at all — see app/models/staff.py StaffRole and
app/models/organization.py OrganizationAdmin.

This slice has no HTTP surface for org administration yet (no admin CRUD
API — out of scope for the demonstrable flow), so these tests exercise the
`require_org_admin` dependency directly, the same way a future admin router
would use it.
